# STRESS TEST: Intentionally BREAKS the Clos fabric!
#
# KEY INSIGHT: spine-to-egress paths are SHARED by all ingress blocks.
# If inputs 1-10 (block 1) each multicast to all 10 egress blocks,
# they exhaust ALL 100 spine-to-egress paths!
#
# Then input 11 (from block 2) trying to multicast to any egress block
# finds NO available spine path and FAILS!

# Inputs 1-10 from block 1: each multicasts to one output per egress block
# Uses ALL spine-to-egress capacity

# NOW: Input 11 tries to multicast to all egress blocks
# All spine-to-egress paths are FULL - this should FAIL!
# Using outputs NOT owned by inputs 1-10 to avoid "already owned" error
# Wait - all outputs 1-100 are used above. There are NO free outputs.

# Alternative: fewer outputs per input, more inputs
# Leave some outputs free, but exhaust spine paths

# Actually, let's just load this file - the above 10 routes with 100 outputs
# uses all capacity. The UI can then try to add route 11.x which will fail.
