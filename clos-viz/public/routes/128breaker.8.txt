# 128breaker - a pattern clos_mult_router can solve but pp128 cannot
#
# Input 1 multicasts to one output in each egress block (8 outputs total)
# Input 2 routes to output 2
#
# clos_mult_router: Solves it using spine sharing for multicast
# pp128_solver: Fails - its algorithm can't handle this multicast pattern
